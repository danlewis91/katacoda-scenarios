I have an idea, let's use containers.

Let's get a server up and running!

The repo you've cloned contains a Dockerfile, have a look at it.

You have to:
1. Create an image out of that Dockerfile
2. Start a container using the new image
3. Make the service available on port 80 so that we can see the page

Bonus question:
- How would you do this without using the Dockerfile, by using the `httpd` image directly?
