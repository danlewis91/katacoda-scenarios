## Information gathering - basic networking

Things are getting interesting, let's figure out how the network is configured!

Can you answer the following:
- What is the local IP address?
- What processes are listening on all interfaces?
- Which IP is the default route for the instance?
- What DNS resolver is being used?

To further explore DNS, can you:
- Find out the ip address of `dwp.gov.uk`{{copy}} ?
- Find out that the mail server for `dwp.gov.uk`{{copy}} is?
- Find out the domain name of the DNS server (reverse lookup)?

Once the above questions are answered, we can proceed to the next step.
