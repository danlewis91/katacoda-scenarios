This step is a bit different, we are going to start working on something.

1. Clone this repo: `https://github.com/julianghionoiu/bash2httpd.git`{{copy}}
2. Try to run the `generate.sh` script
3. Debug and fix the script
4. Use Git to display the changes you've made
5. Add a rule to ignore the generated file
6. Commit your changes to the repo

By the end of this exercise, you should have a HTML file ready to be server by a server.
