Things are getting interesting, let's figure out how the network is configured!

Can you answer the following:
- What is the IP address of the ethernet interface?
- What processes are listening on all interfaces?
- Which IP is the default route for the instance?
- What is the IP address of the public DNS resolver?

To further explore DNS, can you:
- Find out the "A" record of `dwp.gov.uk`{{copy}} ?
- Find out what the mail server for `dwp.gov.uk`{{copy}} is?
- Find out the domain name of the public DNS resolver (reverse lookup)?

Once the above questions are answered, we can proceed to the next step.
